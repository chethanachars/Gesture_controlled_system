**Gesture Controlled System**

## Overview

Gesture Controlled System is an innovative application that enables users to interact with their computers using gestures. This project leverages machine learning to recognize gestures, allowing users to control various aspects of their PC, such as media playback and PowerPoint presentations. Additionally, a secure login system is implemented to enhance user authentication.

## Key Features

### Gesture Recognition
The core functionality of this system is the ability to recognize gestures using machine learning algorithms. The application employs a trained model to interpret user gestures accurately.

### Media Player Control
Users can control media playback on their computers through intuitive gestures. Play, pause, skip, and volume adjustments can be seamlessly performed with simple hand movements.

### PowerPoint Control
Enhance your presentation experience by navigating through PowerPoint slides using gestures. The application allows users to smoothly transition between slides, ensuring a more engaging and dynamic presentation.

### Secure Login System
A robust login system is integrated to ensure the security of user accounts. Users can log in securely, preventing unauthorized access to the gesture-controlled features.
